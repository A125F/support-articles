<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Scheduled workflows are not supported with Dynamic Configurations / Setup Workflows and, <strong>by the end of 2022</strong>, scheduled workflows will be phased out to be replaced by scheduled pipelines as the primary method of scheduling work.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Scheduled Workflows vs. Scheduled Pipelines</h2>
<p>There are many advantages to switching over to scheduled pipelines, some being:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The ability to utilize dynamic configuration without a workaround</li>
    <li>Allowed use of auto-cancelling</li>
    <li>The ability to modify the schedule without having to edit<span> </span><code class="highlighter-rouge language-plaintext" style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">.circleci/config.yml</code>
